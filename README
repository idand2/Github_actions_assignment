CI/CD Strategy & Reasoning
progressive, multi-stage deployment model that emphasizes security and reliability by  validating changes in increasingly production-like environments. The entire process is built on the foundation of immutable artifacts, meaning we build our Docker image once and promote that exact, unchanged artifact through every stage.

The Three Stages of a Release

Feature Branch CI (dev/**): For maximum developer velocity, any push to a branch prefixed with dev/ triggers a lightweight CI workflow. This process runs only the fastest, most essential checks (linting, sanity unit tests, Dockerfile validation) to provide immediate feedback without slowing down the development loop.

Pull Request CI (to main): Before any code can be merged into the main branch, it must pass a comprehensive suite of quality and security gates. This is our primary line of defense and includes:

Full Unit Testing: Unit tests with code coverage analysis.

SAST (Static Application Security Testing): CodeQL scans our source code for potential vulnerabilities.

SCA (Software Composition Analysis): npm audit scans our third-party dependencies for known security issues.

Continuous Delivery (on main): A successful merge to main kicks off the release process, which progresses through two key environments:

Staging: The application is automatically deployed to a production-like staging environment. Here, we run a full suite of end-to-end (E2E) tests to validate the application's behavior in a live, integrated setting.

Production: After staging is verified, the pipeline pauses. A manual approval from a designated reviewer is required to proceed. The production deployment itself is a zero-downtime Blue-Green release managed by a would be robust Python script(not provided).

How to Run/Deploy the Project
The pipeline is designed to be almost entirely automated, with developer interaction centered around the standard Git workflow.

Day-to-Day Development

Create a feature branch using our naming convention: git checkout -b dev/your-feature-name.

Push commits to your branch. The lightweight Feature Branch CI workflow will run automatically, providing fast feedback.

When ready, open a Pull Request to the main branch. This will trigger the full, comprehensive CI workflow. All status checks must pass before merging.

Production Release

Once a Pull Request is merged into main, the Continuous Delivery workflow begins automatically.

After the staging deployment and E2E tests succeed, the workflow will pause and await manual approval for the production release.

An authorized team member must navigate to the GitHub Actions run and approve the deployment to proceed.

Emergency Rollback
- Navigate to the repository's Actions tab.
- Select the Manual Rollback Deployment workflow.
- Click Run workflow.
- Enter the full Git commit SHA of the last known stable version you wish to restore.
- Select the environment (production or staging) to roll back.
- The workflow will redeploy the specified version using the same safe, zero-downtime Blue-Green script.

Assumptions & Decisions Made
Deployment Script: We would chose to implement the Blue-Green deployment logic in Python instead of a shell script. This provides superior error handling, testability, and maintainability, making it a more robust, production-grade solution.

Immutable Artifacts: The entire process is centered on building a Docker image once and promoting it. The rollback.yml workflow correctly redeploys a previous image, not rebuilding from old source code, which is a critical best practice for reliability.

Custom Notification Action: To keep the main workflow files clean and the logic reusable, we created a custom GitHub Action for sending dynamic success/failure/waiting notifications to Slack.

Conceptual Implementation: The deployment steps and notification steps are fully architected but commented out in the workflow files. This is because they rely on secrets (SERVER_HOST, SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, etc.) and infrastructure that do not exist in this context. The logic is complete and ready to be activated once those secrets are provided.

Future Improvements (With Unlimited Resources)
While this pipeline is robust, with more time and resources, we could enhance it further:

Integrate Real-Time Monitoring & Automated Rollbacks: The deployment script would be integrated with a monitoring service like Prometheus or Datadog. A significant spike in error rates or latency immediately following a production deployment would automatically trigger the rollback workflow, creating a self-healing system.

Advanced Deployment Strategies: We would implement Canary Releasing. This would allow us to release new features to a small subset of users (e.g., 1%), monitor performance, and gradually roll it out to 100%, further reducing the risk of a widespread outage.
